Line follower robot using an Arduino Uno R3 and two infrared (IR) sensors. The robot uses the input from the sensors to follow a line on the ground. The left sensor is connected to digital pin 2, and the right sensor is connected to digital pin 3. The left and right motors are controlled using PWM signals on pins 5 and 6, respectively. Adjust the sensor positions and motor connections based on your robot's setup.
